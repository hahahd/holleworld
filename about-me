I am Fei Xing or Dr. Xing, graduated from Uni. of Heidelberg in 2015. This is my first test of Git. I worked a lot with Subversion before. It semms now thaht Git is much more favoriable to all people. Althougth I currently have no idea about Git, I think there must be sth more useful and convenient that Git provides us. OK, let's get start!
